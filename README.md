# ICT_GAC
This python project is meant to emulate an alarm clock, but with a small twist. When the alarm starts ringing, there is no snooze or stop alarm button, instead, you have to either
win or tie against the computer in 1 of 2 games in order to stop it. Although more games could be implemented, the starting ones are just a simple math quiz and tic tac toe.
